Introduction

Hello.

I'll try to keep this "readme" reasonably small. There are few things in the world that I hate more than long "readme" files. Except "coding conventions" - but more on that later...

In this zip file you will find two folders of C++ source code:

Contains files that should clean-compile ON ANY TYPE OF COMPUTER OR SYSTEM WHATSOEVER. It should not be necessary to make ANY changes to these files to get them to compile, except to make up for inadequacies of certain compilers. without changing them AT ALL.

"DataStructuresAlgorithms" - Contains a Data Data Structures Algorithms for practices.

"math" - Contains a series of mathematical formulas to provide theoretical support for the algorithm.

Note that this version of Freeverb doesn't contain predelay, or any EQ. I thought that might make it difficult to understand the "reverb" part of the code. Once you figure out how Freeverb works, you should find it trivial to add such features with little CPU overhead.

Also, the code in this version of Freeverb has been optimised. This has changed the sound *slightly*, but not significantly compared to how much processing power it saves.

Finally, note that there is also a built copy of this version of Freeverb called "Freeverb3.dll" - this is a VST plugin for the PC. If you want a version for the Mac or anything else, then you'll need to build it yourself from the code.
